      <p>Upon completion of the Galvanize Full-Stack program, Klaus would ideally like to find work with an organization focused on promoting culture and the arts, or devoted to a cause of social good, not that two things are mutually exclusive. There's a long way to go and a lot of work to be done before then, so he trusts that the more he is learns, the better idea he will have of where he might like to end up.</p>
