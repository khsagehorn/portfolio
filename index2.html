      <p>Upon completion of the Galvanize Full-Stack program, Klaus would ideally like to find work with an organization focused on promoting culture and the arts, or devoted to a cause of social good, not that those two things are mutually exclusive. There's a long way to go and a lot of work to be done before then, so he trusts that the more he learns, the better idea he will have of where he might like to end up.</p>
